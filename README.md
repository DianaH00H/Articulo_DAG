Modelado de la movilidad urbana en México con redes
bayesianas


Abstract— Urban mobility in Mexico is shaped by socioeconomic, demographic, and contextual factors that affect both transport mode
choice and travel time. This study applies multinomial Bayesian networks to the 2017 Origin–Destination Survey (INEGI) to model these
dependencies under uncertainty. Three candidate directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were specified and fitted by maximum likelihood, and
model fit was compared using BIC and AIC. The third DAG achieved the best fit (BIC = −1,094,177; AIC = −985,745.9) and was therefore
selected as the reference model to address four policy-relevant questions: (i) the probability of automobile use by men traveling for religious
purposes, (ii) the probability that trips longer than 60 minutes are motorized versus non-motorized, (iii) the probability that home-to-school
trips exceed 60 minutes when school transport is used, and (iv) the probability of public transport use (bus, light rail, suburban rail) among
high-stratum individuals in Cuauhtémoc borough on Saturdays. The results indicate that the probability of automobile use by men traveling
for religious purposes is 20.6%. For trips longer than 60 minutes, motorized transport strongly dominates, with a conditional probability of
80.9% compared to 19.3% for non-motorized modes. The probability that home-to-school trips exceed 60 minutes when school transport is
used is very low, at 1.9%. Finally, the probability that high-stratum individuals in Cuauhtémoc borough use public transport on Saturdays
is also low, at 2.1%. These findings highlight the usefulness of Bayesian networks to capture interdependencies in travel behavior and to
inform evidence-based urban mobility planning.
